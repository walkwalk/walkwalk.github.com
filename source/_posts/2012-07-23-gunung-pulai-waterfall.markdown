Last weekend, we revisited **[Gunung Pulai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Pulai)
(or Mount Pulai)** with two of my friends. 

This month (July 2012) happens to be a good season to visit local waterfalls. Rains are driving
up the water level, while we still can enjoy the big sunny days.

Things To Do
------
***Mountain Walk/Biking*** - Most people enjoy walking up the hill in the morning. 
It has a **well-built tar road**, with **1.5 to 2 hours** of walking time 
to reach the summit. [Mountain](http://bikejourneys.blogspot.sg/2010/09/pain-up-gunung-pulai.html) [bikers](http://jeffandkimpaine.com/blog2/2010/07/11/gunung-pulai-translates-to-crazy-man-ride/) love the steep slopes here.

***Picnic and Swimming*** - That's what we went for! :) The main waterfall is **20-minute walk from entrance gate**. It
has a **small pool** with cold fresh running water, starting from shallow to over 2-meter deep.

***Photographing*** - In a sunny morning, you will see **sun rays shine through tree leaves** on the way 
to the waterfall. Don't miss that!

***Save the Earth*** - There are a lot more polystyrene plates and cups scattered all over the waterfall site, since my last visit. Before we left, my friend Kok Haur decided to help cleaning up the mess, but we definitely **need more hands**!

Local Tips
----
- ***Come early*** - **Morning is the best time** for picnic and mountain
  walk. Part of the waterfall site and mountain track are directly
  exposed under the afternoon sunlight.
- ***Parking*** - You will see a **carpark space** at the entrance with RM1 fee. 
- ***Washroom*** - There is **one small washroom** at the parking site for you
  to change clothes and shower.
- ***Leeches*** - If you follow wet dirt track towards the waterfall,
  watch out for leeches. Bring some garlic, **leeches hate garlic smell**. 
- ***Eat*** - No food stalls in the village. Usually I have my breakfast
  in **Kulai town**, and for lunch as well.

Hidden Waterfalls!
------
As I know, there are **2 more waterfall sites hidden further** in the
mountain. I will blog about them when I go there again. Stay tune!
