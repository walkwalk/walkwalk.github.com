Last weekend, we went to **Tanjung Balau beach** to enjoy a starry night 
and more important, to watch the [**Perseids meteor**](http://www.spacedex.com/perseids/) shooting stars!

The night sky was clear and full of stars before 9pm. It was beautiful. 
But from then on, the sky was **covered by clouds, well, til the next morning**.
I guess we will wait for the [next meteor rain in November](http://www.spacedex.com/leonids/).

We had a great BBQ though. :)

Local Tips
-----
- ***Ramadan Promotion*** - Ramadan (Muslim's fasting month) is a good season to visit. Look for **resorts that offer promotion rates**. This year (August 2012), Pelangi Balau Resort offer MYR 80 (50% off) for Standard Room (without breakfast).
- ***Eat during Ramadan*** - It can be **tricky to find food in Penawar town** during fasting month. 
  **Bring your own food** (what we did :), or eat **seafood at [Pengerang](http://wikitravel.org/en/Pengerang)** (30-minute driving distance from Desaru).
- ***BBQ at Public Beach*** - to **avoid extra charges** from your resort. The **jetty beach is a good spot** for campfire and BBQ, and safer since it's nearer to the resort.
- ***Bring Torch Light*** - the beach is **really dark** after sunset.
